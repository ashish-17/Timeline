\textnormal{
Events in the past, play a major role in shaping our future. World Wide Web has
all the information related to such events, but it is scattered all over the
web and there is no automated way to unite this information and study such
events for entities of interest. Our aim is to build a system which can collect
such data from web and use it to build a time-line of major events pertaining
to an entity. Here entity is a generic term we are using to represent an
organization, country, person etc.

\section{Project Description}\label{sec:1. Project Description}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Project playback is about gathering data from web using various web scrapping
methods and then extracting information about events of interest from the
collected data using various machine learning techniques. We will be using Java
to develop most of our system components along with a backend built using
hadoop and mongoDB. Our project falls in two categories "Massive Algorithmics"
and "Scalable Algorithms Infrastructure". 

We believe that a time-line view of events and activities for an entity of
interest will give a new perspective for exploring data on internet. Instead of
viewing information organized in form of sections we will be showing it
organized in form of a time-line. The intent is to give a bird's eye view of
evolution of the entity over the time and study that evolution process based on
data we call as the events of interest.

It is feasible to complete the system in 6 weeks time if we consider only a
limited set of entities to analyse. For e.g. if we limit the system's input to
only consider fortune 500 companies or 200 most significant people in science
field then we should be able to deliver a working system within 6 weeks. The
main stumbling blocks for this project are identifying seeding sources for
data, deploying a web-scraper with hadoop backend, cleaning the retrieved data,
analysing the data using machine learning techniques and finally creating a web
application to query for time-line data.

The project has four stages: Gathering, Design, Infrastructure Implementation,
and User Interface.
