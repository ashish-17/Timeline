The complexity of modern analytics needs is outstripping the available
computing power of legacy systems. Distributed system like Hadoop compliments
this requirement for storing and analyzing huge sets of information by
providing a platform for parallel processing of large data sets stored over
multiple machines. This project aims to setup a Hadoop infrastructure and
demonstrate its power for big data analysis. Some machine learning models will
also be deployed in this system so that developers can directly call
corresponding APIs to execute training and testing models.
