\section{Project Description}
\label{sec:project-description}

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for
distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on
computer clusters built from commodity hardware. Hadoop stores data as it comes
in - structured or unstructured - saving time on configuring data for
relational databases. In our project we will store a large dataset in Hadoop
file system and use it for analysis of events from various sources like news,
twitter etc. Our project falls in the category \textit{Scalable Algorithms
Infrastructure}. The main stumbling points for this project are identifying a
large dataset for Hadoop, configuring Hadoop for multiple clusters and building
a data analytics system over Hadoop.

The project has four stages: requirement gathering, design, infrastructure
implementation, and user interface.
