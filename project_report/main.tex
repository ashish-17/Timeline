\textnormal{%
Events in the past play a major role in shaping our future. World Wide Web has
abundant information related to such events, but it is scattered all over the
web. There is no automated and efficient way to organize this information and
to study such events for a specific entity of interest, where entity here
refers to a generic term to represent an organization, country and person etc.
This project aims to build a web-based automate system that can collect such
data from heterogeneous online sources, extract condensed description of
events, and integrate them into a timeline pertaining to an entity. This
largely benefits those who would like to study history events of a certain
company or organization in chronological order.

\section{Project Description}\label{sec:project-description}

Project Playback is about gathering data from web using various web scrapping
methods and then extracting information about events of interest from the
collected data using several machine learning algorithms. We will use Java
to develop most of our system components along with a backend built using
Hadoop and MongoDB. Our project falls in two categories \textit{Massive
Algorithmics} and \textit{Scalable Algorithms Infrastructure}.

We believe that a timeline view of events and activities for an entity of
interest will give a new perspective for exploring data on Internet. Instead of
viewing information organized in form of sections we will be showing it
organized in form of a timeline. The intent is to give a bird's eye view of
evolution of the entity over the time and study that evolution process based on
data we call as the events of interest.

It is feasible to complete the system in 6 weeks if we consider only a limited
set of entities to analyse. For example, if we limit the system's input to only
consider fortune 500 companies or 200 most significant people in computer
science field, then we should be able to deliver a working system within 6
weeks. The main stumbling blocks for this project are identifying seeding
sources for data, integrating a real-time web-crawler into the system, cleaning
the retrieved data, extracting events of condensed description, reorganizing
events of companies and finally visualizing timeline data in a web-based
system.

The project has four stages: requirement gathering, design, infrastructure
implementation, and user interface.
