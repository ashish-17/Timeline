\textnormal{%
The complexity of modern analytics needs is outstripping the available
computing power of legacy systems. Distributed system like Hadoop compliments
this requirement for storing and analyzing huge sets of information by
providing a platform for parallel processing of large data sets stored over
multiple machines. This project aims to setup a Hadoop infrastructure and
demonstrate its power for big data analysis. Some machine learning models will
also be deployed in this system so that developers can directly call
corresponding APIs to execute training and testing models.

\section{Project Description}\label{sec:project-description}

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for
distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on
computer clusters built from commodity hardware. Hadoop stores data as it comes
in - structured or unstructured - saving time on configuring data for
relational databases. In our project we will store a large dataset in Hadoop
file system and use it for analysis of events from various sources like news,
twitter etc. Our project falls in the category \textit{Scalable Algorithms
Infrastructure}. The main stumbling points for this project are identifying a
large dataset for Hadoop, configuring Hadoop for multiple clusters and building
a data analytics system over Hadoop.

The project has four stages: requirement gathering, design, infrastructure
implementation, and user interface.
