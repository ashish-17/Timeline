# Wikipedia data analysis using Hadoop

## Page view counts
We use page view count data (Hourly) from wikipedia log dumps and plot a curve for changing page view counts over the sampling time interval.

## Trending Wikipedia pages
In this module we calculate a daily trend factor for all wikipedia pages using a simple baseline algorithm. We then plot the value of this trend factor with the page view count curve to verify the output. In future we  plan to compare the trend factor of all the wiki pages to find the top 10 trending wikipedia pages of a daily basis.

## Page rank calculation
We use the wikipedia page link graph to calculate the page rank of all the wikipedia pages. Then we use this data to compare the page rank of some popular wiki pages. We believe the the page rank of a Wiki page can be vused to fing if a Wiki page is authoratative or not.
